# Attack-Simulation
This project utilizes Microsoft Defender’s Attack Simulation Training to enhance end-user security awareness. The simulation was designed to educate users about phishing risks and evaluate their readiness to identify and report phishing attempts.

## Process Overview:

### Launch Attack Simulation:

Accessed the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 portal and initiated a new attack simulation.

### Select Technique:

Chose the “How-to Guide” technique.
This technique sends a phishing email containing a step-by-step guide instructing users on tasks like reporting phishing messages.

## Outcome:
The attack simulation provided valuable insights into the organization’s current security posture. 
Key metrics included the number of users who:
- Opened the phishing email.
- Clicked on the link.
- Reported the phishing attempt successfully.
Post-simulation feedback sessions were held to discuss findings, enhance user awareness, and implement further training.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:

- Proficiency in leveraging Microsoft Defender for attack simulation.
- Designing and executing phishing awareness campaigns.
- Assessing organizational resilience against phishing threats.
- Enhancing end-user security awareness through hands-on education.
